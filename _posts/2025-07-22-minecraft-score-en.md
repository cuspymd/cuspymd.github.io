## 🎵 The Minecraft Music We Never Knew We Knew

A recent Billboard article caught my attention.  
Titled ["How Minecraft's Score Became Big Business for Composer"](https://www.billboard.com/pro/how-minecraft-score-became-big-business-for-composer/), 
this piece reveals how seemingly simple game music evolved into **billions in revenue and cultural significance**.

The protagonist is German indie composer **C418 (Daniel Rosenfeld)**.  
Back in 2009, during Minecraft's early days, he collaborated with Notch  
to compose the game's music, making a crucial decision:  
**retaining ownership of the music copyrights himself.**

This choice would bear tremendous fruit over time.

## 💰 Music, and Business

While game music typically belongs to the publisher,  
Minecraft's music was different.  
C418's two albums, **Volume Alpha (2011)** and **Volume Beta (2013)**,  
continue to be beloved on streaming platforms,  
with **hundreds of millions of plays** on Spotify alone.

As a result, these tracks transcended simple game BGM  
to become **lo-fi BGM**, **ASMR music**, and **emotional work music**.  
In 2025, portions of these albums were inducted into the **National Recording Registry**,  
officially recognizing their cultural value.

Moreover, when Jack Black's brief theme song from the 2025 *Minecraft movie*  
hit the Billboard charts, interest in the original music exploded again.  
Thanks to this, C418's albums reached **#1 on the UK Soundtrack Charts**,  
achieving unprecedented success in game music history.

## 🌌 The Background Melodies We Had Been Missing

Minecraft's music is peculiar.  
Unlike most game music that swells grandly during battles or events,  
it plays **when nothing is happening**.  
And that sound flows **slowly, very quietly, like background ambience**.

This is why many players ask, **"Was there music?"**  
But that's also evidence that the music **blended so naturally into the world**.

## 🍃 Music That Resonates in Empty Spaces

What makes Minecraft's music special is that  
**it doesn't forcibly extract emotions**.  
Instead of evoking feelings,  
it creates **space to hold emotions**.

This music resonates in empty spaces,  
**quietly, slowly, calling forth** the player's memories and feelings.

And as time passes,  
that quiet music continues to become  
small comfort for more and more people.
