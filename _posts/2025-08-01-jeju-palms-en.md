When traveling around Jeju Island, you'll be amazed by the exotic scenery created by towering palm trees. These palm trees give you the illusion of being in Southeast Asia or Hawaii, but when exactly did they first take root on Jeju Island?

## The History of Jeju Island's Palm Trees: A Product of State-Led Tourism Development

Many people are surprised to learn that palm trees are not native to Jeju Island. The introduction of palm trees to Jeju Island began in earnest in the 1960s with the government's special regional development plan for Jeju Island.

### The 1960s: The Beginning of Tourism Development

In 1963, following the May 16th coup, the 'Jeju Island Construction and Development Research Committee' was established under the direction of the chairman of the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction, marking the beginning of serious government interest in Jeju Island development. In 1964, the Ministry of Construction established the 'Jeju Island Construction Comprehensive Plan,' focusing on tourism development with five regions—Jeju City, Hallasan, Seogwipo, Seongsan, and Daejeong—designated as tourism hubs.

In 1962, Jeju Governor Kim Young-gwan began advocating for Jeju's tourism industry development by citing Hawaii as an example, comparing Jeju Island to Hawaii. This was when the vision of making Jeju Island "Korea's Hawaii" began to take concrete shape.

### The 1970s-80s: The Full-Scale Palm Tree Era

In the 1970s, Jeju Island emerged as a preferred honeymoon destination for affluent couples. From the early 1980s, thousands of Washington palm trees were planted throughout the island to create a tourist city image.

With the development of the Jungmun Tourism Complex in 1982, Washington palm trees were planted, officially creating Jeju Island's exotic landscape. Palm trees planted as street trees from 1982 onward created Jeju Island's iconic scenery for over 40 years.

This shows that Jeju Island's palm trees are not a natural landscape but rather the result of systematic, state-led tourism development policies.

## Why Are Palm Trees So Tall?

When you look at Jeju Island's palm trees, they tower so high into the sky that they can make your neck ache. The reason palm trees grow so tall is the result of evolution for survival.

**To win the competition for sunlight**: In tropical and subtropical regions, various plants compete for sunlight. Since palm trees only have leaves at the top, they must grow as tall as possible to receive sufficient sunlight.

**For seed dispersal**: Being high up allows them to use sea breezes to spread their seeds far and wide.

**To prepare for natural disasters**: Although tall, their flexible trunks allow them to bend rather than break during typhoons or strong winds, helping them survive.

## Types of Palm Trees You Can Meet on Jeju Island

### 1. Washington Palm
This is the most commonly seen palm tree on Jeju Island. It features characteristic fan-shaped large leaves and grows 15-25m tall. It's relatively cold-resistant, making it the best adapted to Jeju's climate. However, be careful when approaching as the leaf stems have thorns.

### 2. Canary Island Date Palm
This palm tree features beautiful feather-shaped elegant leaves. It gives a more magnificent and tropical feeling than Washington palms, making it preferred by luxury resorts and hotels. Although it grows slowly, it has a long lifespan and can produce date fruits under the right conditions.

### 3. Queen Palm (Cocos Palm)
This boasts the most delicate and elegant appearance. Its feather-like leaves swaying in the breeze create a very beautiful sight. However, it's sensitive to cold, so on Jeju Island, it only grows well in coastal areas or warm regions.

## Palm vs. Palm Tree: What's the Difference?

This is a point that confuses many people. **Palm** refers to the fruit, while **palm tree** refers to the tree that bears those fruits. Coconuts and dates are 'palms,' and the trees that bear them are 'palm trees.'

## Why Can't You Drink Palm Beverages on Jeju Island?

It's hard to find the refreshing coconut water you might have enjoyed in Southeast Asia on Jeju Island. The reasons are:

- **Primarily ornamental**: Most palm trees on Jeju Island were planted for ornamental purposes.
- **Non-fruit bearing varieties**: Washington palms and others don't produce edible fruits.
- **Pollination issues**: Canary Island Date Palms have separate male and female trees, so proper pollination often doesn't occur.
- **Climate limitations**: Tropical fruits like coconuts need hotter and more humid climates to properly ripen.
- **Economic inefficiency**: Low yields make it economically inefficient to produce beverages commercially.

## Conclusion: Artificial Beauty Creating Jeju's Unique Landscape

Jeju Island's palm trees are not a natural landscape but artificial beauty created through systematic, state-led tourism development policies from the 1960s. Under the vision of "Korea's Hawaii," they have become a precious asset that creates Jeju Island's unique charm over 60 years.

However, many palm trees are being removed recently due to safety concerns, so they may become increasingly rare to see in the future. When you travel to Jeju Island next time, don't just see them as pretty photo backgrounds—remember these fascinating stories. Each palm tree will feel much more special!
